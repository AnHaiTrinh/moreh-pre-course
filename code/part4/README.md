## Setup virtual environment for Python

This part has some Python coding problems. You'd better setup a virtual environment to complete these exercises.

1. Create and activate your virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now the prompt in your terminal should be prefixed by `(venv)` to indicate that you are in the virtual environment.

2. Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: These are the versions reported on my machine, which uses Python 3.10. You may need to update the versions of these packages to be compatible with your machine*
